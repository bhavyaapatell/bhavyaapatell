Hi, Iâ€™m Bhavya Patel ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a third-year Computer Science and Business Administration double degree student at Wilfrid Laurier University. My academic journey bridges technology and business, with a strong focus on software development and data-driven problem solving.

Iâ€™ve gained experience through academic projects and leadership roles, building solutions that combine programming, analytics, and creative problem-solving. My technical toolkit includes Python, Java, C/C++, SQL, JavaScript, TypeScript, Rust, Swift, HTML/CSS, and Bash, along with frameworks and tools like React, Svelte, Astro, Tailwind, Docker, Git, and Google Cloud.

Iâ€™m always eager to learn emerging technologies, build impactful projects, and explore how AI and innovation can shape the future of business and finance.
